# Balablox
A simple game written in GameMaker Studio 2.0

Balablox is a reimagining of a game I wrote in 1987.

It's a platform game where you control a small blue square character through fifteen levels, avoiding monsters, jumping on ropes, climbing ladders, and collecting coins and powerups. It was loosely based on the short film "Balablok", from the Canadian National Film Board or NFB.

The new version has all the features of the old version, but with pixel-smooth graphics (instead of the character-based graphics of the original) and with added color, sound, and music. My old Heathkit had none of those features!

The game is scheduled for a limited release by the end of 2022.
